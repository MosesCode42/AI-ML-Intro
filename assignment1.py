# 1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be
# integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.
# 

# They are all values and expressions.
# * is mathematical operator for multiplication
# 'hello' is a string value which can also be written using double quotes "hello"
# -87.8 is a floating point value or a decimal point number
# - is a minus used for subtraction
# / is division operator which will always return a float number
# + is an addition operator for adding integers and concatination 
# 6 is an integer number or a whole number
# 

# 2. What is the difference between string and variable?

# A string is a value that represents a text using a single or double quotes while a variable is the name give to store any type of information or data type.

# 3. Describe three different data types.

# -> Text data type which is a String
# -> Numeric data types which include integers (whole numbers), floating point numbers (decimal numbers) and comlex data types that consists of two values (real part and imaginary part) 
# ->Boolean data type is data type that has two possible values True or False

# 4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?

# An expression is made up values, variables, operators and calls to function that needs to be evaluated.
# Expressions produces results after being interpreted by the Python interpreter 

# 5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an
# expression and a statement?

# An expression produces results after being interpreted while a statement is a line of code commanding a task for the result to be produced. 

# 6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
# bacon = 22
# bacon + 1

# 23

# 7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
# 'spam' + 'spamspam'
# 'spam' * 3

# They all produce the same value 
# spamspamspam

# 8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?

# It is the conventional way, you cannot use an integer literal in Python such as 40. Variable names must follow certain rules

# 9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string
# version of a value?

# int()
# float()
# str()

# 10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
# 'I have eaten' + 99 + 'burritos.'
# 

# It is not possible to concatinate a string with an integer. You fix it by '99'
# 
# 'I have eaten'+'99'+'burriots'
